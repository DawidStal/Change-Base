# Change-Base
A program to change a given number from one base to another.
The program asks for three inputs: the base in which the number is represented, the base to which the number should be transformed into and the number. The program then proceeds to change the base of the number and outputs it's value in changed base. 
Note that digits after 9 for higher bases are represented by lower case alphabetic characters (e.g. "ten" is a, "eleven" is b etc.).
